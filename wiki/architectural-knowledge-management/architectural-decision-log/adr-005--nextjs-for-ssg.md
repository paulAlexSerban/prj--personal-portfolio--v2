# ADR-005: Choosing a JAMstack Solution

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The personal portfolio project has chosen the JAMstack architecture for its speed, scalability, and security advantages. To implement JAMstack, various solutions are available, each with different trade-offs in terms of features, performance, ease of use, and flexibility.

This ADR explores several JAMstack solutions and presents a decision based on the project’s requirements, including ease of development, scalability, deployment, and integration with APIs and dynamic content.

## Decision
After evaluating the available options, **Next.js** has been chosen as the JAMstack solution for the project. Next.js provides an optimal balance between static site generation (SSG) and server-side rendering (SSR) capabilities, allowing for a flexible and performant setup while offering a robust developer experience.

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. **Next.js**
   - **Pros**:
     - **Hybrid Rendering**: Supports both static site generation (SSG) and server-side rendering (SSR), offering flexibility for static pages and dynamic content.
     - **API Routes**: Built-in API routes allow easy integration of dynamic backends without the need for an external server.
     - **Performance Optimization**: Includes built-in features like image optimization, automatic static optimization, and fast refresh for efficient development.
     - **Developer Experience**: Rich developer tools, great TypeScript support, and a strong community. It is widely adopted in the industry and well-documented.
     - **Deployment**: Optimized for deployment on platforms like Vercel, which offers seamless CI/CD pipelines for static and dynamic content delivery.
   
   - **Cons**:
     - **Overhead**: The flexibility of Next.js (supporting both SSG and SSR) might introduce unnecessary complexity for projects that are purely static.
     - **Learning Curve**: While generally well-documented, Next.js has more features and complexity than simpler JAMstack solutions, which may require additional learning.

### 2. **Gatsby**
   - **Pros**:
     - **Static Site Generation**: Gatsby is built for static site generation, making it highly optimized for building static websites with excellent performance.
     - **Data Layer**: It features a powerful GraphQL-based data layer that allows content to be fetched from multiple sources (CMS, Markdown, APIs) and integrated easily into the static build.
     - **Rich Plugin Ecosystem**: Gatsby has a large plugin ecosystem that simplifies integration with CMSs, analytics, and other services.
     - **Out-of-the-box Performance**: Automatic optimizations for images, JavaScript, and other assets ensure that Gatsby sites are fast by default.
   
   - **Cons**:
     - **Build Times**: For larger projects with a significant amount of content, Gatsby’s static build times can become slow, leading to delays in the CI/CD pipeline.
     - **Overhead for Dynamic Content**: Although Gatsby can fetch dynamic data, it is primarily optimized for static content. Implementing dynamic features requires more effort and may not be as efficient as Next.js or other hybrid frameworks.
     - **Limited Flexibility**: Unlike Next.js, Gatsby is more focused on SSG and lacks built-in SSR support, which could limit options for dynamic content.

### 3. **Hugo**
   - **Pros**:
     - **Performance**: Hugo is known for its incredibly fast build times, even with large content-heavy projects. It can handle static content generation at a much faster pace than most other JAMstack solutions.
     - **Simplicity**: Hugo is simple to use for building static sites without complex dependencies or advanced configurations.
     - **Flexibility**: It supports a wide variety of templates and configurations, allowing for customization without requiring a full-fledged framework.
   
   - **Cons**:
     - **Limited Ecosystem**: Hugo’s ecosystem is not as extensive as Next.js or Gatsby. It has fewer plugins and integrations for more complex content management or API integrations.
     - **Static Only**: Hugo is limited to static site generation with no support for server-side rendering or API routes, making it less flexible for projects that require dynamic functionality.
     - **Developer Experience**: Hugo does not have the same rich developer experience as Next.js, especially in terms of built-in tools like fast refresh or seamless integrations with modern JavaScript frameworks.

### 4. **Nuxt.js**
   - **Pros**:
     - **Vue.js Integration**: Built on Vue.js, Nuxt.js provides the same benefits for developers familiar with Vue, including a clear and simple component-based architecture.
     - **Hybrid Rendering**: Like Next.js, Nuxt.js supports static site generation (SSG) and server-side rendering (SSR), offering flexibility between static and dynamic pages.
     - **Modular Architecture**: Nuxt.js has a rich module system that simplifies tasks such as handling authentication, state management, or integrating third-party services.
     - **Great Developer Experience**: Offers features like auto-importing components, hot reloading, and other developer-friendly tools.
   
   - **Cons**:
     - **Smaller Ecosystem**: Although Nuxt.js has a growing community, its ecosystem and plugin library are not as large or mature as Next.js or Gatsby.
     - **Learning Curve**: For developers unfamiliar with Vue.js, adopting Nuxt.js could present a significant learning curve compared to other JavaScript frameworks like React (Next.js).

### 5. **11ty (Eleventy)**
   - **Pros**:
     - **Simplicity**: 11ty is a simple static site generator with minimal dependencies. It is easy to set up and configure for small to medium-sized static websites.
     - **Flexibility**: Unlike more opinionated frameworks, 11ty offers flexibility in templating and content management, without locking developers into a specific pattern.
     - **Lightweight**: 11ty is highly performant and does not impose any JavaScript framework on the frontend, keeping the footprint small and the build process fast.
   
   - **Cons**:
     - **Limited Features**: 11ty lacks the rich feature set of Next.js or Gatsby. It is primarily focused on static site generation without built-in support for more complex use cases like API routes or SSR.
     - **Manual Configuration**: While 11ty’s flexibility is a strength, it also means that developers must manually configure more aspects of the build process, which can lead to longer setup times for more complex sites.

## Decision Criteria
When selecting the JAMstack solution, the following criteria were prioritized:
- **Performance**: The solution must offer high performance, both in terms of build times and page load speeds.
- **Flexibility**: The solution must support both static and dynamic content, allowing the portfolio to scale and add features as needed.
- **Developer Experience**: A good developer experience with modern tools and integrations is important to facilitate smooth development cycles.
- **Community and Ecosystem**: A large and active ecosystem is desirable to ensure access to plugins, integrations, and community support.
- **Scalability**: The chosen solution must allow for easy scaling in terms of both traffic and content as the project grows.

## Decision
**Next.js** has been chosen as the solution for the JAMstack architecture due to its hybrid rendering capabilities (SSG + SSR), rich feature set, and strong developer experience. It provides a flexible architecture that can accommodate both static and dynamic content, making it ideal for a portfolio that may evolve over time. Next.js also has an extensive ecosystem and deep integration with deployment platforms like Vercel, making it a robust and future-proof choice.

## Consequences
- **Increased Complexity**: While Next.js offers powerful features, it comes with added complexity compared to simpler static site generators like Hugo or 11ty. However, the trade-off is justified given the flexibility and scalability needed for the portfolio.
- **Learning Curve**: Developers new to Next.js will need to spend time learning its features, but the large community and excellent documentation help mitigate this challenge.
- **Scalable Backend Needs**: For dynamic content, the project will require integration with APIs or a backend, but Next.js offers built-in solutions for this (API routes), making the transition smooth.

## Alternatives Considered (Revisited)
1. **Gatsby** was not chosen due to longer build times and limitations with dynamic content.
2. **Hugo** was rejected because it lacks flexibility for dynamic content, though it offers excellent build performance for purely static sites.
3. **Nuxt.js** was not chosen because of its smaller ecosystem and the team's preference for React over Vue.js.
4. **11ty** was ruled out because it lacks the features and ecosystem needed for a more complex portfolio project with both static and dynamic content.
