# Architecturally Significant Requirements

## Overview

Architecturally Significant Requirements (ASRs) are the key decisions that shape the architecture of a software system. They are the high-level constraints and design choices that have a significant impact on the system's structure, behavior, and quality attributes. ASRs help guide the development team in making informed decisions and ensure that the architecture aligns with the project's goals and requirements.

### 1. Use of Node.js 20.18 (LTS)

- **ASR-001: Runtime Compatibility**  
  The backend must be built using Node.js 20.18 (LTS) to ensure long-term support, stability, and access to the latest features and performance optimizations.
- **ASR-002: Dependency Management**  
  All packages and libraries used in the backend must be compatible with Node.js 20.18 to avoid runtime issues and ensure consistency in development environments.

### 2. Monorepo Setup with Lerna

- **ASR-003: Monorepo Structure**  
  The project must adopt a monorepo structure to house all components (frontend, backend, shared libraries) within a single repository, ensuring easy management, versioning, and refactoring.
- **ASR-004: Dependency Management**  
  The monorepo must facilitate shared dependencies across multiple projects, minimizing redundancy and ensuring consistency across components.

### 3. Transition from Nx to Lerna
- **ASR-005: Familiarity with Tooling**  
  The project must leverage Lerna for monorepo management due to the development team's expertise, allowing for faster development cycles and easier maintenance.
- **ASR-006: Simplicity Over Complexity**  
  The architecture must prioritize simplicity and ease of use by adopting Lerna, as the project's scope does not require advanced orchestration features provided by Nx.
- **ASR-007: Simplified CI/CD**  
  The project must support a unified CI/CD pipeline to build, test, and deploy all components from a single repository, reducing complexity and improving deployment efficiency.
- **ASR-008: Build Performance**  
  While using Lerna, the architecture must maintain acceptable build performance. If necessary, additional performance optimization strategies should be implemented as the project scales.

### 4. General Requirements

- **ASR-009: Code Quality and Testing**  
  The architecture must enforce high code quality through automated testing, linting, and code review processes across all components of the monorepo.
- **ASR-010: Documentation**  
  The project must maintain comprehensive documentation for all architectural decisions, tooling choices, and component interactions to ensure that future developers can easily understand and contribute to the project.
- **ASR-011: Husky and Commit Lint**
  The project must use Husky and Commit Lint to enforce commit message conventions and pre-commit hooks, ensuring consistent and readable commit history.
- **ASR-012: Versioning**  
  The project must implement a coherent versioning strategy across all components to maintain compatibility and manage releases effectively.
- **ASR-013: Scalability**  
  The architecture must be designed to accommodate future growth, allowing for the addition of new components, services, or libraries without significant restructuring.
- **ASR-014: Security**  
  The architecture must implement security best practices, including regular dependency audits and adherence to secure coding guidelines, to protect the application from vulnerabilities.

### 5. Static Site Generation (SSG)

- **ASR-014: Static Content Rendering**
  The portfolio and blog must render static content using **Static Site Generation (SSG)** to ensure fast load times, improved SEO, and ease of deployment.
- **ASR-015: Pre-Build Static Pages**
  All blog posts and portfolio items must be pre-built into static HTML pages at build time, ensuring that the static files are ready to serve directly from the CDN or hosting platform without further server-side processing.
- **ASR-016: Fast Page Load Times**
  The architecture must prioritize **fast performance** by serving pre-generated static HTML files to reduce server response times and optimize user experience.
- **ASR-017: SEO Optimization**
  The site must be SEO-friendly by ensuring that search engines can easily crawl and index pre-rendered static HTML pages, improving search visibility for blog posts and portfolio items.
- **ASR-018: Scalability with Minimal Infrastructure**
  The site architecture must be easily **scalable**, requiring minimal server infrastructure. The pre-generated static files should be deployable to a **Content Delivery Network (CDN)** (e.g., AWS S3, Netlify), allowing the site to handle a high volume of traffic without performance degradation.
- **ASR-019: Low Maintenance**
  The chosen architecture must minimize maintenance by not requiring real-time server-side rendering. This reduces the need for complex backend infrastructure and lowers operational overhead.
- **ASR-020: Build and Deployment Process**
  The build process must allow for periodic rebuilds whenever new content (e.g., blog posts or portfolio items) is added. The deployment must be automated to regenerate and redeploy the static site efficiently after content updates.
- **ASR-021: Static Hosting and CDN Compatibility**
  The generated static files must be compatible with popular static hosting platforms and **CDNs** to ensure fast, reliable delivery of content across different geographic regions.
- **ASR-022: Content Update Mechanism**
  Updates to content must be incorporated through **rebuilds** of the static site, which will be triggered during content updates or additions (e.g., new blog posts). The build process must remain efficient as the site grows.
- **ASR-023: Limited Need for Real-Time Data**
  The architecture will not support real-time data out of the box. If future requirements involve real-time updates, a client-side hydration approach or API-based solution will need to be evaluated.
