# Architecturally Significant Requirements

Architecturally Significant Requirements (ASRs) are the key decisions that shape the architecture of a software system. They are the high-level constraints and design choices that have a significant impact on the system's structure, behavior, and quality attributes. ASRs help guide the development team in making informed decisions and ensure that the architecture aligns with the project's goals and requirements.
