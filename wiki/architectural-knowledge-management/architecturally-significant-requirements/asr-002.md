# ASR-002. Monorepo Setup with Lerna

- **ASR-003: Monorepo Structure**  
  The project must adopt a monorepo structure to house all components (frontend, backend, shared libraries) within a single repository, ensuring easy management, versioning, and refactoring.
- **ASR-004: Dependency Management**  
  The monorepo must facilitate shared dependencies across multiple projects, minimizing redundancy and ensuring consistency across components.
