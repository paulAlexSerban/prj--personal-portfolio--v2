# ASR-003. Transition from Nx to Lerna

- **ASR-005: Familiarity with Tooling**  
  The project must leverage Lerna for monorepo management due to the development team's expertise, allowing for faster development cycles and easier maintenance.
- **ASR-006: Simplicity Over Complexity**  
  The architecture must prioritize simplicity and ease of use by adopting Lerna, as the project's scope does not require advanced orchestration features provided by Nx.
- **ASR-007: Simplified CI/CD**  
  The project must support a unified CI/CD pipeline to build, test, and deploy all components from a single repository, reducing complexity and improving deployment efficiency.
- **ASR-008: Build Performance**  
  While using Lerna, the architecture must maintain acceptable build performance. If necessary, additional performance optimization strategies should be implemented as the project scales.
