# ASR-005. Architecturally Significant Requirements for JAMstack Architecture

- **ASR-015: Fast Load Times**  
  The application must serve pre-built static assets to ensure rapid load times, leveraging CDNs for efficient global distribution.
- **ASR-016: Minimized Attack Surface**  
  The architecture must minimize security vulnerabilities by avoiding traditional server-side processing, reducing the risk of attacks associated with server-based applications.
- **ASR-017: Independent Scaling**  
  The architecture must support independent scaling of static assets and dynamic content APIs, ensuring that the application can handle varying traffic loads efficiently.
- **ASR-018: Static Site SEO**  
  The application must be designed to facilitate search engine indexing by serving static content, ensuring that all pages are easily crawlable by search engines.
- **ASR-019: Modern Development Workflow**  
  The architecture must support a streamlined development workflow using modern frameworks (e.g., Next.js or Gatsby) that promote efficiency, enabling easy integration with tools and libraries.
- **ASR-020: Flexible API Usage**  
  The architecture must allow for seamless integration with third-party APIs or microservices for dynamic content and functionalities, ensuring flexibility in feature expansion.
- **ASR-021: Static Content Management**  
  The architecture must provide a mechanism for managing static content efficiently, allowing for easy updates and deployments without significant downtime.
- **ASR-022: Continuous Deployment**  
  The application must support a continuous deployment strategy to facilitate automatic deployment of changes to static assets, ensuring that updates are delivered to users promptly.
- **ASR-023: High Code Quality Standards**  
  The architecture must enforce high code quality through automated testing, linting, and code review processes, ensuring maintainability and reliability.
- **ASR-024: Comprehensive Documentation**  
  The architecture must maintain comprehensive documentation covering architectural decisions, tooling choices, and workflows to ensure that future developers can understand and contribute to the project easily.
