# ASR-006. Architecturally Significant Requirements for Choosing a JAMstack Solution

## 1. Performance
- **ASR-025: Fast Build Times**  
  The solution must provide efficient build times, particularly as the content grows, ensuring that the CI/CD pipeline is not slowed down by large content or codebases.
- **ASR-026: Optimized Page Load Speeds**  
  The solution must optimize for fast page load speeds by leveraging static site generation, CDNs, and other performance-enhancing techniques like lazy loading and image optimization.

## 2. Flexibility
- **ASR-027: Hybrid Rendering (SSG + SSR)**  
  The solution must support both Static Site Generation (SSG) and Server-Side Rendering (SSR), allowing flexibility between static content and dynamic features depending on the requirements of each page.
- **ASR-028: API Integration**  
  The architecture must easily integrate with third-party APIs or internal microservices for dynamic content and features, ensuring flexibility as the project evolves.

## 3. Scalability
- **ASR-029: Scalability of Content**  
  The solution must allow the project to scale seamlessly with increasing content and traffic, ensuring that the site remains performant under high load.
- **ASR-030: CDN Compatibility**  
  The solution must be compatible with content delivery networks (CDNs) to distribute static assets globally, ensuring fast load times regardless of user location.

## 4. Developer Experience
- **ASR-031: Developer-Friendly Tools and Ecosystem**  
  The solution must offer a rich set of developer tools (e.g., hot reloading, TypeScript support, linting, and code splitting) and a large, active ecosystem that provides plugins, libraries, and integrations to speed up development.
- **ASR-032: Strong Documentation and Community Support**  
  The solution must have comprehensive documentation and a strong community to ensure that developers can resolve issues quickly and access resources for learning and best practices.

## 5. SEO Optimization
- **ASR-033: Pre-rendered SEO-Friendly Content**  
  The solution must pre-render static pages to facilitate search engine indexing and provide good SEO performance for content-heavy sections of the portfolio.

## 6. Integration with Modern Deployment Platforms
- **ASR-034: Seamless CI/CD and Deployment Pipelines**  
  The solution must support modern deployment platforms (e.g., Vercel, Netlify) and enable automatic, continuous deployment with minimal setup.

## 7. Code Quality and Maintainability
- **ASR-035: Modular Code Structure**  
  The solution must promote a modular code structure, allowing for easy maintenance and scalability as the project grows, without leading to technical debt.

## 8. Customization and Extensibility
- **ASR-036: Extensibility for Future Features**  
  The architecture must allow for future expansion, enabling the addition of new features (such as a blog, portfolio gallery, or dynamic API-driven content) without requiring a major overhaul.

## 9. Image and Asset Optimization
- **ASR-037: Built-in Image Optimization**  
  The solution must include automatic image and asset optimization to reduce page load times and improve the overall performance of the site.

## 10. Security
- **ASR-038: Secure Dynamic Content Handling**  
  The architecture must handle dynamic content securely, ensuring that API calls, client-side requests, and other dynamic interactions follow security best practices.
