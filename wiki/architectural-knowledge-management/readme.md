> FROM: https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture-decision-record

- architecture decision record (ADR) - document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences.
- architecture decision (AD) - software design choice that addresses a significant requirement.
- architecture decision log (ADL) - collection of all ADRs created and maintained for a particular project (or organization).
- architecturally-significant requirement (ASR) - requirement that has a measurable effect on a software systemâ€™s architecture.
All these are within the topic of architecture knowledge management (AKM).
The goal of this document is to provide a fast overview of ADRs, how to create them, and where to look for more information.
